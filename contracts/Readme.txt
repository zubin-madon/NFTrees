Will try a couple of variants of contracts. Want to try and get rid of ERC721 Enumerables. It is a gas guzzler apparently.
There is a sample json file. We must replicate this for every tree. The number keeps getting appended to match the SVG filename (filename will simply be a number in sequence).
Base uri https://flexyourtrees.s3.filebase.com (/1.SVG for first tree and so on...).
Jsons will be at https://flexyourtrees.s3.filebase.com/jsons (/1.json for the first tree and so on...).
